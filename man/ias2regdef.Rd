\usage{
ias2regdef(fname, write.regdef = TRUE, reg.sep = NA, baseline.offset = 0,
  scrnW = NA, scrnH = NA, fnt.name = NA, fnt.size = NA, chrW = NA,

}
\arguments{
\item{fname}{A string containing the name of a SR Research IAS 
file ("*.ias"). Columns in file from left to right must be: 
Interest Area Type (Rectangular), Region Number, x1 (left 
boundary), y1 (top boundary), x2 (right boundary), y2 (bottom 
boundary), Region Label.}

\item{write.regdef}{A boolean value of whether or not a converted 
region definition file will be written. Default value is 
\code{TRUE}.}

\item{reg.sep}{A string of characters that denotes the region 
separator in the region labels. Default value is \code{NA}, 
which indicates that region boundary is not specified within the
region labels, and region labels will be catenated with 
\code{"\t"} in between to determine the locations of the region 
boundaries. If \code{reg.sep} is specified by the user, the 
\code{reg.sep} string will be replaced by \code{"\t"} to 
determine the locations of the region boundaries.}

\item{baseline.offset}{Number of pixels of which the baseline of 
each line is above from y2. Default value is \code{0}.}

\item{scrnW}{Screen width in pixels (integer).}

\item{scrnH}{Screen height in pixels (integer).}

\item{fnt.name}{Font name used for stimulus text.}

\item{fnt.size}{Nominal font size in points for text display.}

\item{chrW}{Letter width in pixels, assuming a monospace font is 
used.}

\item{chrH}{Nominal letter height in pixels.}

\item{ln.space}{Line spacing in pixels for multi line texts.}

\item{baseline}{Baseline positions for each line of text. Measured
in pixels from the top of the screen.}

\item{mrgn.top}{Top margin of the screen in pixels.}

\item{mrgn.left}{Left margin of the screen in pixels.}

\item{mrgn.bottom}{Bottom margin of the screen in pixels.}

\item{mrgn.right}{Right margin of the screen in pixels.}

\item{rgn.maxH}{Extent of regions of interest above baseline in 
pixels.}

\item{rgn.minH}{Extent of regions of interest below baseline in 
pixels.}

\item{rgn.padL}{Expand leftmost region on each line leftward by 
this amount in pixels.}

\item{rgn.padR}{Expand rightmost region on each line rightward by 
this amount in pixels.}
}
\value{
A vector of strings containing the region definition. The 
  vector includes a yaml block with values for each of the 
  function parameters except for \code{fname}, 
  \code{write.regdef}, \code{reg.sep}, and \code{baseline.offset}.
  In addition to the yaml block, the vector will include a pair of
  lines for each line of text in the stimulus. The first element 
  of each pair is the text displayed on that line. The second 
  element is a regioning string made up of square brackets ("[", 
  "]"), and pipe ("|") characters. An opening bracket ("[") 
  indicates the start of a line and a closing bracket ("]") 
  indicates the end of a line. Pipes ("|") indicate region 
  boundaries within a line.
  
  By default, the output vector is also written to a region 
  definition file (*_regdef.txt) using the file name of the input 
  .ias file. The region definition file can be hand edited to add 
  or correct information in the yaml block, or to re-specify 
  region placements.

\description{
Convert SR Rsearch IAS (Interest Area Set) file 
  (*.ias) to a region definition file (*_regdef.txt). The latter 
  is suitable for hand editing and can be used to generate 
  alternative region specifications (e.g., multi word regions) for
  text stimuli.
}
\details{
If not specified, \code{baseline}, \code{chrH} and 
  \code{chrW} will be calculated based on \code{x1}, \code{x2},
  \code{y1}, and \code{y2} in the .ias file such that:
  \itemize{
  \item{\code{baseline = y2 - baseline.offset} for each line of text}
  \item{\code{chrH = (y1 - y2)/2} for each line of text}
  \item{\code{chrW} is the smallest differece between region 
  widths (i.e., \code{x2 - x1} of each region) among all regions. 
  (Note that it is assumed the font of the stimulus text is 
  monospace, and the estimation for \code{chrW} with proportional 
  fonts could be very off.)}
  }
  
  Region labels (the last column in the .ias file) should be the 
  content of the actual stimulus for each region, especially in 
  terms of the number of characters or items within each region, 
  in order to generate optimal regdef files. This way, when
  converting regdef to other formats, the region widths in the
  regioning string can be directly converted into the actual
  region widths in the stimulus. For example, if the stimuli are
  color patches instead of text (like in Rapid Automatized
  Naming), it may be ideal to use a single letter to stand for
  each color as the region label, instead of using the whole name
  of a color.
