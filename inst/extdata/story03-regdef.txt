Cowboy was without a doubt the ugliest horse in the world. Even so, I
[     |   |       | |     |   |       |     |  |   |      |    |   |]

loved him beyond all reason. I realized that my only chance to compete
[    |   |      |   |       | |        |    |  |    |      |  |      ]

would be in the speed events, since events based on appearance were out of
[    |  |  |   |     |       |     |      |     |  |          |    |   | ]

the question. I chose barrel racing and came in next to last, while Becky,
[  |         | |     |      |      |   |    |  |    |  |     |     |     ]

who rode a big brown thoroughbred mare, won every time. For the whole next
[  |    | |   |     |            |     |   |     |     |   |   |     |   ]

month I woke up early every day and rode Cowboy five miles to the arena and
[    | |    |  |     |     |   |   |    |      |    |     |  |   |     |  ]

trained. On the way home from the arena, I would be so tired; those five
[       |  |   |   |    |    |   |      | |     |  |  |      |     |   ]

miles seemed twice as long. In the following competition, I sat at the gate
[    |      |     |  |     |  |   |         |            | |   |  |   |   ]

while I watched Becky and her horse race through the course with ease. My
[    | |       |     |   |   |     |    |       |   |      |    |     | ]

turn finally came. At the signal, we dashed toward the first barrel,
[   |       |     |  |   |       |  |      |      |   |     |      ]

whipped around it and with perfect precision rounded the second and the
[      |      |  |   |    |       |         |       |   |      |   |  ]

third. When we passed the finish line, the crowd was silent. We had beaten
[     |    |  |      |   |      |     |   |     |   |       |  |   |     ]

Becky and her thoroughbred! I realized then that no matter what the odds,
[    |   |   |             | |        |    |    |  |      |    |   |    ]

I'd always come out a winner if I worked hard for it.
