Alex and Tim are lost. Alex's wife had recently passed away and he couldn't
[   |   |   |   |     |      |    |   |        |      |    |   |  |       ]

find the motivation to live a normal life. Tim has been charged with
[   |   |          |  |    | |      |     |   |   |    |       |   ]

embezzlement and is going to prison soon. The thought of that terrified
[           |   |  |     |  |      |     |   |       |  |    |        ]

him. So they decided to take a ride down the river rapids at Cataract Canyon.
[   |  |    |       |  |    | |    |    |   |     |      |  |        |      ]

A river only goes one way. If you are lost, that is good. Alex has never

rafted down this river before, but Tim has many times. Tim tells Alex that
[     |    |    |     |       |   |   |   |    |      |   |     |    |   ]

the rapids can be a dangerous place. Boats can overturn and people fall
[  |      |   |  | |         |      |     |   |        |   |      |   ]

in. Concerned, Alex asks a river guide for advice. The guide tells him
[  |          |    |    | |     |     |   |       |   |     |     |  ]

"sometimes things don't go as planned on the river, and they turn for the
[         |      |     |  |  |       |  |   |      |   |    |    |   |  ]

worst. You might find yourself struggling, fighting against the force of the
[     |   |     |    |        |           |        |       |   |     |  |  ]

river. When that happens in nature, it's best to surrender. You'd never
[     |    |    |       |  |       |    |    |  |          |     |    ]

hear a football coach tell you that, to surrender, but on the river its
[   | |        |     |    |   |     |  |          |   |  |   |     |  ]

okay."
